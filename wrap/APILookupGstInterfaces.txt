#Notes for the gstreamerD developer:
#The work on wrapping gstreamerD automatically isn't complete yet.
#At the moment gstreamerc/gstreamer.d and gstreamerc/gstreamertypes.d
#have to be copied from hand edited versions from wrap/.
#The copying is done automatically in APILookup.txt
#Also GstGhostPad.d has to have it's constructor adjusted by hand,
#and this isn't done automatically. You should replace Pad* with GstPad*.
#I have no idea why GtkWrapper is doing that.
#Also it creates two unnecessary files gstreamerc/lib.d gstreamerc/libtypes.d
#which have to be removed by hand.



# These are enums for gstreamer. There should be a way for these to be moved to APILookupGStreamer.txt.
# currently it just hangs up. These don't work for the moment.
#enumType: GST_ELEMENT_FLAG_LAST GstElementFlags.FLAG_LAST
