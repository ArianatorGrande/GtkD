/**
 * Description
 * Cairo is a graphics
 * library that supports vector graphics and image compositing that
 * can be used with GDK. Since 2.8, GTK+ does most of its drawing
 * using Cairo.
 * GDK does not wrap the Cairo API, instead it allows to create Cairo
 * contexts which can be used to draw on GDK drawables. Additional
 * functions allow to convert GDK's rectangles and regions into
 * Cairo paths and to use pixbufs as sources for drawing operations.
