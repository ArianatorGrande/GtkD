 * \section version_1 First version 1.00 release date unknown
 *
 * The first version will allow to use all the widgets from the GTK+ toolkit.<br>
 * This includes only the higher level functions of the GTK+ library.<br>
 * The libraries ATK, GDK, glib and Pango are not implement or have a very limited
 * implementation when needed to support the implemented function of the GTK+ library.<br>
 * An example of "use" will include setup a combo box, display, change the items,
 * respond to the user actions and retrieve the selected item.<br>
 * Not implemented will be changing the color or the font of the combo box.
 *
 * \section version_2 second version 2.00 release date unknown
 *
 * The second version will include the most common low level function of GTK+<br>
 * ("most common" and "low level" are still to be defined)<br>
 * This will include the Pango, GDK, glib and ATK libraries (by that order)
 * 
 *
 * \section version_Other Other versions
 * 
 * other version will try to keep up with GTK+ development and will have a numbering
 * that makes reference to the GTK+ releases
 *
 * \section extensions Extensions to GTK+
 *
 * DUI will try to include other extensions to GTK+.<br>
 * the first example already on the development version is the OpenGL extension GtkGlExt.<br>
 * The wrapping to GtkGlExt is created on a separate library (libduigl).<br>
 * Extensions to GTK+ that are available on the two main target environments of DUI
 * (Linux/un*x and wind*ws) will be preferred to others that don't support all environments.<br>
 * DUI will probably become a set a 3 libraries libdui, libduigl and libduiext<br>
 * libduiext might be slip into the target environments.
