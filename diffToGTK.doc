 *
 * \section naming 
 * 
 * - all the underscore characters where dropped ("_") as they look ugly
 * - when a name is composed by more than one word the first character of each word is capitalized
 * - all the "g" prefixes where dropped
 * - all the "gdk", "gtk" tokens where dropped
 * 
 * \section callbacks
 * 
 * Callbacks are implemented as listener interfaces.
 * functions like
 * - gtk_button_pressed
 * - gtk_button_released
 * - gtk_button_clicked 
 * 
 * are not implemented at all as it makes no sense to have a button executing some action, buttons
 * are there to pass on user events not executing actions.<br>
 * This is specially true since D does not support anonymous inner classes.<br>
 * With an anonymous inner class that extends the button class we could to execute some action
 * but then we would have the context of the outer class.<br>
 * (If D ends up supporting anonymous inner classes maybe this could be reviewed)<br>
 * 
 * See the \ref listeningToEvents page.
