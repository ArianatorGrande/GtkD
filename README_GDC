Notes on building gtkD and gtkD-based apps with GDC.
=======================================================================

Support for building gtkD using GDC is limited at the moment. Supported
versions are GDC 0.22 and 0.23. Versions 0.24 and 0.25 are NOT supported
and will not work. If you're using DSSS to build your own programs with
gtkD, please append "-no-export-dynamic" to your buildflags.
