INSTALL
--------------------------------

TO USE COMPD, YOU'LL NEED TO COPY EVERYTHING FROM THE compd FOLDER TO ROOT!

CompD is being phased out of GtkD. By Release 1.0, CompD will no longer be included 
or be a supported method of compiling!

Install instructions for GtkD 
a) make sure you have installed dool 
http://svn.dsource.org/projects/dool

** you really only need compd from this.

b) build dool (using compd)
#compd GtkD.compd

c) build the test application
#compd GtkDTests.compd 

--------------------------------
For GL bindings
#compd GtkDgl.compd
Tests
#compd GtkDSimpleGL.compd
#compd GtkDShapesGL.compd

-------------------------------
For GDA (www.gnome-db.org)
#compd gda.compd
#compd gdaTests.compd

-------------------------------
See wrap/Readme.txt for details on how to generate the code.


You can also use the included .sh or .bat scripts to compile gtkD.
