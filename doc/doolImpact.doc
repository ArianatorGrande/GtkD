 * \section dool
 * 
 * DUI now requires dool (included on the windows installer)<br>
 * this proved to be the long term solution for the changes introduces with DMD 0.91<BR>
 *
 * \section Impact
 *
 * The impact of dool is minimum:
 * - DUI methods never return char[] but an instance of the class String
 *  - to convert a String to char[] call the method .toString() on the String object
 * - all DUI I/O is done through the dool io classes instead of the phobos functions
 *  - transparent to the user
 *
 * as DUI is not a string processing library nor a IO supplier these changes are very minimal to the user (programmer).
 * <br><BR>
 * it's not expected that the influence of dool over DUI will ever become greater.
