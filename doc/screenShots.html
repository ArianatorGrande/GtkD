<p class="warning">Warning</P>

These code examples should not be used as D code examples as the author was an
 absolute D beginner at the time these were coded and left out many of the features of D.<br>
 The author used only a subset of the features of D that he was familiar from other languages.<br>

 <p class="section"> See some images and the DUI code that generated them</P>
 
 DUI aims to implement all the GTK+ widget and most (almost all) GTK+ functions.<br>
 If you familiar GTK you will find it very easy to start creating GUI applications with DUI.<br>
 If you are familiar with any type of GUI toolkit then working with DUI should also be very easy<br>
 <br>
 Here are some examples generated by DUI. Obviously these will look exactly like any GTK+ images<br>
 When you change the look and feel of your GTK (from the <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org">gnome</A> configuration panels for instance)
 the DUI look and feel will also change <br>
 see the \ref scalesPage page for an example of an alternative look.
