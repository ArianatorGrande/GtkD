 * \section introduction
 * DUI is mostly a 1 to 1 wrapper of GTK+ on a fully OO packaging and so it reflects all it's good and otherwise features.<br>
 * DUI does have some decorator functions to facilitate it's use, more are planed.<br>
 * Most of the usage of DUI is straightforward, create widget, add widgets to containers...
 * there is nothing new there and we expect that this is not your first contact with a GUI toolkit.
 * If that's not true a brief look at the GTK+ tutorials might be a good starting point
 * as they are far more complete then DUI documentation.<br>
 * The completion of a proper DUI manual depends as much on DUI success as DUI success depends on a good manual.
 *
 * This tutorial is also (mainly) a reference tool for my own use.
 *
 * \section menus
 * 
 * \code
 		MenuBar menubar = new MenuBar();   // name is self explanatory
		Menu menu;  	// idem
		
		menu = menubar.append("_File");
 * \endcode
 *
 * With GTK+ to see a menu on a menu bar we have to:
 * - create a new menu item
 * - append a new item to the menu bar
 * - create a new menu
 * - set the new menu as submenu of the new item
 *
 * that's done by the statement \code menu = menubar.append("_File"); \endcode<br>
 * after the menu is created to add items to it:
 * \code
 		menu.append(new MenuItem(myMenuItemListener, "E_xit","file.exit"));
 * \endcode
 *
 * where myMenuItemListener is a MenuItemListener.<br>
 * this will create a new menuItem with "New" as Label and "x" as the menu mnemonic<br>
 * and sets the myMenuItemListener to listen to the activate signal from the item.
 * the action string if set to "file.exit"
 *
 * \note ItemFactory is not implemented yet
